== OPTIONS

=== Root Menu

Contains the application menu(s) found on the system and activated in 
*FNS-MenuConfigurator*. Choose a folder or an application entry which 
should appear in the personal menu.

[NOTE]
===============================
Respectively only one entry per selection is possible.
===============================

=== Personal Menu

Contains the favorite application entries and folders if +.personal+ found 
in +~/.fvwm-nightshade/+. The entries can be sorted with drag'n'drop.

[NOTE]
===============================
In the Statusbar at the bottom of the window the last selected entry 
(Root or Personal) is shown with the type (Application/Folder), its name 
and the command (application only).
===============================

=== Buttons

*Add >*::
+
Adds the selected root menu entry. It will be pasted below of the selected 
personal menu entry. If no one is selected it will be put at the end of the list.

*< Remove*::
+
Removes the selected personal menu entry.
+
[NOTE]
===============================
Removing a folder removes ALL entries below!
===============================

*Create*::
+
Opens a dialog to add a custom application or folder entry to personal menu.
+
For more details see _Create Dialog_ chapter below.

*Save*::
+
Saves the changed menu in +.personal+. A backup of the previous personal menu 
will be created, too (+.personal.bak+).

*Quit*::
+
Closes *FNS-MenuBuilder*.


=== Create Dialog

With the _Create_ button a dialog appears to build a custom entry. Two types 
can be chosen - an application or folder entry.

*Icon Button*::
+
With the Icon button an own icon can be selected. Clicking opens a selection dialog 
in the icon theme directory set in *FNS Base Setup*. No icon change creates an entry 
without an icon.
+
[NOTE]
===============================
For highest quality choose a greater size than set in *Regenerate Menu(s)*. 
Default is 24.
===============================

*Commandstring*::
+
Add here the command with or without parameters. Clicking the button to the right 
opens a dialog to choose the wanted executable/script. Both are active if _Application_ 
is chosen.

*Label*::
+
The shown menu name of the folder or application.

*Create*::
+
Adds the custom entry under the selected personal menu entry. If no one selected it appears 
at the end of the list.

*Cancel*::
+
Closes the dialog without adding a custom entry to personal menu.

== FILES

The new menu entries are saved in +~/.fvwm-nightshade/.personal+.

A backup file +.personal.bak+ is created every time a new menu is saved.

[NOTE]
===============================
It overwrites an existing backup. So only the previous personal menu exists!

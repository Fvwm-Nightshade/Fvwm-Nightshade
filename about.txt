What is Fvwm-Nightshade?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First of all what is it not - it is not a new desktop and it is not a 
standalone application. So what is it then? It is a lightweight but 
feature rich and good looking configuration of http://www.fvwm.org[Fvwm]. 
It contains many useful things to make work and life easier with a 
flavor of a modern desktop.

Why we developing Fvwm-Nightshade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fvwm is a fast, stable and highly configurable windowmanager, despite of 
his age it can keep up with younger desktop environments easily.

Unfortunately Fvwm has three problems, beginners become frightened to test it:

1. Most distributions containing a too old version of Fvwm in their 
repositories (e.g. 2.5.27). Since release 2.6 older versions of Fvwm are 
no longer supported and therefore interested persons have to compile Fvwm 
from source.
2. If this was successfully done and Fvwm is started, not much will be 
shown. Searching the web for better configurations than the default one 
discovers many results. There are good looking and feature rich 
configurations (e.g. http://www.fvwmforums.org/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=39&sid=756bd760e51a044f86fe29e295592d5a[FvwmForum - Screenshot & Configs], 
http://box-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=7314&PHPSESSID=42743de7ba1f15717817f5f2b3342296[Box-Look.org - Fvwm Themes]) 
but trying them to run ends up mostly in frustration to get them working 
(except http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/[FVWM Themes] and 
http://home.gna.org/fvwm-crystal/[FVWM-Crystal]). People try to test 
some of them with more or less good results but at the end Fvwm is 
removed and replaced with Xfce, Lxde or Openbox because ...
3. Mostly of the configurations are too complicated/confusable. Or they're 
made for one desktop resolution only. Some are too old or made for static 
systems. To adapt them means to become acquainted with Fvwm's huge 
documentation, but RTFM isn't that what normal users like. They want to 
install a desktop environment and then work with it, not experimenting 
many days to get it work.

This is why we developing Fvwm-Nightshade. We want to show

- how easy it is to install
- how good and modern looking Fvwm can be
- how fine it is for daily work
- that it can work out of the box
- some specials other desktop haven't

Ok, Fvwm-Nightshade isn't complete (which environment is that ...) but 
with the users help it will be in the future. Give it a try and tell us 
your impressions.

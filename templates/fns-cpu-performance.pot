"The following governors are available:\n\n"
"Performance:\nThis governor sets the CPU statically to the highest frequency within the borders "
"of Min Frequency and Max Frequency. Consequently, saving power is not the focus of this governor.\n\n"
"Powersave:\nThe CPU frequency is statically set to the lowest possibility. This can have severe "
"impact on the performance, as the system will never rise above this frequency no matter how busy "
"the processors are.\nHowever, using this governor often does not lead to the expected power "
"savings as the highest savings can usually be achieved at idle through entering C-states. Due "
"to running processes at the lowest frequency with the powersave governor, processes will take "
"longer to finish, thus prolonging the time for the system to enter any idle C-states.\n\n"
"On-demand:\nThe kernel implementation of a dynamic CPU frequency policy: The governor monitors "
"the processor utilization. As soon as it exceeds a certain threshold, the governor will set the "
"frequency to the highest available. If the utilization is less than the threshold, the next "
"lowest frequency is used. If the system continues to be underutilized, the frequency is again "
"reduced until the lowest available frequency is set.\n\n"
"Conservative:\nSimilar to the on-demand implementation, this governor also dynamically adjusts "
"frequencies based on processor utilization, except that it allows for a more gradual increase in "
"power. If processor utilization exceeds a certain threshold, the governor does not immediately "
"switch to the highest available frequency (as the on-demand governor does), but only to next higher "
"frequency available.\n\n"
"Userspace:\nThis governor allows the user, or any userspace program running with UID 'root', to "
"set the CPU to a specific frequency. 'userspace' is not supported yet, but to get the same result "
"use governor 'powersave' and one of the frequencies in 'Min Frequency', or governor 'performance' "
"in combination with 'Max Frequency'."

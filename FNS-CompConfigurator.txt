== DESCRIPTION

*FNS-CompConfigurator* is used to configure composition like shadows, fading, 
translucency, and more. Supported composite managers are: _xcompmgr_ and _compton_.

the transset/transset-df utility, primitive window transparency.

Two composite manager are supported:

*xcompmgr*::
+
XcompMgr is the standard composition manager for the X Composite extension. 
It implements shadows, fading, proper translucency, and more.

*compton*::
+
Compton is a compositor based on xcompmgr. In addition to shadows, fading 
and translucency, it implements window frame opacity control, inactive 
window transparency, and shadows on argb windows.

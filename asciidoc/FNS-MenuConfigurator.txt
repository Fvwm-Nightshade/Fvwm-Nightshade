== NAME

FNS-MenuConfigurator - SimpleGtk2 perl program to configure the root menu 
in Fvwm-Nightshade.


== SYNOPSIS

Module FNS-MenuConfigurator

*FNS-MenuConfigurator* can only be invoked by fvwm. Command line invocation 
of the *FNS-MenuConfigurator* module will not work.

== DESCRIPTION

*FNS-MenuConfigurator* is used to configure the appearance of the root menu. 
It is the graphical user interface of *fns-menu-desktop* - a revised version 
of _fvwm-menu-desktop_ which reads XDG menu files and creates Fvwm menus.

== OPTIONS

=== Multiple Menu

In this tab all XDG menus found on the system are shown. All selected menus 
will integrate in one Fvwm menu. Note that equal menus found under 
+/etc/xdg/menus+ AND +\~/.config/menus/+ following the XDG menu specification 
only shown in +~/.config/menus/+. If you want to generate a custom-assembled 
menu switch to the 'Single Menu' tab.

=== Single Menu

In this tab you can define a custom-assembled menu 'foo-bar.menu' placed on 
another location as defined in the XDG menu definitions. 

Note:
===============================
If the menu doesn't exist, nothing happens.
===============================

*Menu Top Title*::
+
pecifies the menu title of the top menu used by Fvwm's Popup command. Default is 'FvwmMenu'.

*Desktop*::
+
Overrides the name of the main desktop environment installed on the system. If a 
system offers multiple desktop environments +$XDG_MENU_PREFIX+ is typically set. 
It is ignored if this field is used. Possible names: _gnome, kde, lxde_, etc.

*Install-Prefix*::
+
Overrides the standard locations for XDG menu definitions. The standard locations 
are +/etc/xdg/menus+ and +~/.config/menus+ if available.

*Menu Type*::
+
Defines which type of menu should be found. Possible name types could be: 
_applications, settings, preferences_, etc. 

Note:
===============================
If the specified menu type doesn't exist the generated menu is empty!
===============================

=== General Options

*Use Icons*::
+
Option enables mini-icons in the menu(s).

*Icon Size*::
+
If 'Use Icons' is set, by default 24x24 mini-icons are used. If another size 
is desired change the wanted size in this field.

*Icon Theme*::
+
Sets the used icon theme. Default is 'gnome' but all others found in +~/.icons+ or 
+/usr/share/icons+ can used except the hicolor theme because it's the default 
fallback theme if no icon is found. Note that the theme name must be written 
exactly as the icon directory e.g. +/usr/share/icons/Mint-X+ => 'Mint-X'.

*Directory Icon*::
+
If 'Use Icons' is enabled and for a directory in a menu no icon is found 
'gnome-fs-directory' as default icon is used. But if the gnome icon theme 
isn't installed no default icon appears. Another icon can defined here. 
Only the name of an icon is needed not the path!

*Application Icon*::
+
If 'Use Icons' is enabled and for an application no icon is found 'gnome-applications' 
as default icon is used. But if the gnome icon theme isn't installed no default icon 
appears. Another icon can defined here. Only the name of an icon is needed not the path!

*Icon Directory*::
+
If the specified icon isn't that size it is converted if ImageMagick is installed. 
Generated icons are saved in +$FVWM_USERDIR/icons+ or the directory specified here. 
Otherwise no icon appears in the menu for that entry.

*Use Titles*::
+
If this option is set menus are generated with titles. Default is no titles.

*Menus in Menu*::
+
Enable this checkbox to insert generated menu(s) IN a menu.

*InMenu*::
+
Enter in this field the name of the menu (its top title) where the generated 
menu(s) should insert. For more information see the USAGE section in the man 
page of fns-menu-desktop.

*Output Path*::
+
Enter here the FULL path of the menu to store. Default path is +$FVWM_USERDIR/.menu+.

=== Buttons

*Generate*::
+
Generates the menu(s).

*Help*::
+

*Save*::
+

*Cancel*::

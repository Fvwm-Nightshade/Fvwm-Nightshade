== NAME

FNS-BaseSetup - Perl module to configure base settings of Fvwm-Nightshade


== SYNOPSIS

Module FNS-BaseSetup

*FNS-BaseSetup* can only be invoked by fvwm. Command line invocation 
of the *FNS-BaseSetup* module will not work.

== DESCRIPTION

*FNS-BaseSetup* is used to configure the base settings of Fvwm-Nightshade 
while first startup or if you want to change core parts like font, layout or the
default terminal, etc.


== OPTIONS

=== Environment

*Splash On*::
+
Fvwm-Nightshade supports startup images (png, xpm or gif) called "splashs"  
shown with FvwmBanner. You can activate or deactivate the showing of it by 
seting the checkbox. The path of the image can entered directly or via button.


*Composite Manager On*::
+
With the checkbox a composite manager for shadows and translucency can be 
enabled (if installed). Two of them are supported:
+
XcompMgr::::
+
It is the standard composition manager for the X Composite 
extension. It implements shadows, fading, proper translucency, and more.

Compton::::
+
It is a compositor based on xcompmgr.  In addition to shadows, 
fading and translucency, it implements window frame opacity control, 
inactive window transparency, and shadows on argb windows.

+
Configure one by clicking the _Configure_ button to open *FNS Composite 
Configurator*.


=== Desktop

*Wallpaper Dirs*::
+
Since version 0.8 of Fvwm-Nightshade more than one wallpaper directory in 
addition to ~/.fvwm-nightshade/wallpapers is supported. They can be 
specified in the text entry separated with a _colon_.


*Icons on Desktop*::
+
With this checkbox icons on desktop can be enabled. This feature is 
offered by PcmanFm so if activated the root window is under its' control. 
Therefore the root menu of Fvwm-Nightshade must moved around to the right 
click desktop menu. Anyway it can be shown already with the Super_L key.


*Icon Size*::
+
Over this combo box the size of the desktop icons can be set. Over 
PcmanFM's settings => display => Big Symbols the can set, too.


*Desktop scrolling On*::
+
Desktop scrolling is set per default but some people don't like those 
switching to another desktop while scrolling with the mouse to the edges 
of the current screen. So with this checkbox it can be disabled.


*Desktops*::
+
In earlier versions of Fvwm-Nightshade only 4 desktop pages were possible. 
Now up to 10 desktop pages can be configured. More are possible but as only 
numbers from 0-9 are available needed for key bindings to move windows 
(SHIFT+ALT+0-9) or switch to another desktop (SHIFT+CTRL+0-9) we decided to 
limit it to 10.
+
The raster depends on the set layout. Mostly the horizontal amount can be 
changed. Only the _Vertical_ layout has the possibility to change the 
vertical amount.


=== Decoration & Panels

*Used Layout*::
Fvwm-Nightshade has 4 different layouts how components like pager, icon 
manager, panels are positioned:
+
Horizontal::::

of the screen.

Vertical::::

G2like::::
+
This layout is based on the Gnome 2 layout - a top panel with menu, 
favorites, systray, cpu bar and clock/date. A bottom panel with a minimize 
all button, the task bar and a pager.

Klike::::
This one is based on the KDE layout - a bottom panel with menu, task bar, 
pager, systray, cpu bar and clock/date.

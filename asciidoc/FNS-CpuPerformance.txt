== NAME

FNS-CpuPerformance - SimpleGtk2 perl program to configure cpu governor.


== SYNOPSIS

FNS-CpuPerformance

== DESCRIPTION

*FNS-CpuPerformance* is used to configure the cpu governor. Two tools 
are supported: _cpufreq_ and _cpupower_.

== CPU Information

It contains the CPU model, the count and the manufacturer.

== CPU Configuration

Two types of tabs exists - one to configure the cores as a whole and 
one for each core of the CPU. 

Deeper information about the CPU and its core(s) can be called in each tab, too.

=== Joined

In this tab the governor behaviour of the whole CPU is settable if they're 
not unlocked.

*Unlock cores*::
+
Each core can be configured separately to set governor and frequencies 
if this checkbox is set. 

*Governor*::
+
In this combobox the available governor can be chosen. For more information 
about the different governors see _Governors_ chapter below.

*Min Fequency*::
+
Sets the minimum used frequency from the range of available frequencies.

*Max Fequency*::
+
Sets the maximum used frequency from the range of available frequencies.

*Information to Cores*::
+
Show deeper information about the cpu by clicking _More_.

=== Core [n]

Each core has its own tab to set governor and frequencies separately. 

[NOTE]
===============================
The options are only active if "Unlock cores" is set.
===============================

*Governor*::
+
In this combobox the available governor can be chosen. For more information 
about the different governors see _Governors_ chapter below.

*Min Fequency*::
+
Sets the minimum used frequency from the range of available frequencies.

*Max Fequency*::
+
Sets the maximum used frequency from the range of available frequencies.

*Information to Core n*::

=== Governors

The following governors are available:

*Performance*::
+
This governor sets the CPU statically to the highest frequency within the 
borders of Min Frequency and Max Frequency. Consequently, saving power is 
not the focus of this governor.

*Powersave*::
+
The CPU frequency is statically set to the lowest possibility. This can have 
severe impact on the performance, as the system will never rise above this 
frequency no matter how busy the processors are.
+
However, using this governor often does not lead to the expected power savings 
as the highest savings can usually be achieved at idle through entering C-states. 
Due to running processes at the lowest frequency with the powersave governor, 
processes will take longer to finish, thus prolonging the time for the system 
to enter any idle C-states.

*On-demand*::
The kernel implementation of a dynamic CPU frequency policy: The governor 
monitors the processor utilization. As soon as it exceeds a certain threshold, 
the governor will set the frequency to the highest available. If the utilization 
is less than the threshold, the next lowest frequency is used. If the system 
continues to be underutilized, the frequency is again reduced until the lowest 
available frequency is set.

*Conservative*::
+
Similar to the on-demand implementation, this governor also dynamically adjusts 
frequencies based on processor utilization, except that it allows for a more 
gradual increase in power. If processor utilization exceeds a certain threshold, 
the governor does not immediately switch to the highest available frequency 
(as the on-demand governor does), but only to next higher frequency available.

*Userspace*::
+
This governor allows the user, or any userspace program running with UID 'root', 
to set the CPU to a specific frequency.
+
[NOTE]
===============================
'Userspace' is not supported yet, but to get the same result use governor 
'powersave' and one of the frequencies in 'Min Frequency', or governor 
'performance' in combination with 'Max Frequency'.
===============================

=== Apply

Applies the current settings to the cpufreq system.

[NOTE]
===============================
This is only active for the current session. After reboot it falls back 
to default settings. Therefore the settings are saved in ~/.fvwm-nightshade/.governor 
for later use or while autostart if set.
===============================

=== Cancel

Closes *FNS-CpuPerformance* without setting the custom governor configuration.

=== Add to Autostart

To use the changes permanently after each login enable this checkbox.

== FILES

The new settings are saved in +~/.fvwm-nightshade/.governor+ after each 'Apply'.

If Autostart is enabled +.governor+ is added to +~/.fvwm-nightshade/.autostart+.

fvwm-nightshade - a feature rich configuration for F? Virtual Window 
Manager (FVWM) for X11.

SYNOPSIS
--------

None


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*Fvwm-Nightshade* aims to be a lightweight but feature rich and good looking 
configuration of Fvwm. It contains many useful things to make work and 
life easier with a flavour of a modern desktop. In this document you find 
how *Fvwm-Nightshade* is constructed, how to handle it, its’ bindings and 
how you can customize it (e.g. new themes or layouts).


USAGE
-----

First Start
~~~~~~~~~~~
*Fvwm-Nightshade* checks while your first login if +~/.fvwm-nightshade+ exist. 
If not a setup dialog appears where you can change things like used theme 
and font, which layout, default terminal and browser you want.

After clicking "Apply & Save" your settings will be activated and 
*Fvwm-Nightshade* is ready to use. If you want to change the settings 
again you can do that over the menu point
----
Configuration -> Fvwm-Nightshade -> Fvwm-Nightshade-Setup
----


Desktop Organisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Three different desktop layouts available:

* Horizontal (default)
* Vertical
* G2like (Gnome 2 based)

You can change it via Fvwm-Nightshade-Setup or over the menu
----
Configuration -> Fvwm-Nightshade -> Decorations -> Layouts
----

Below each layout is described in detail.

Horizontal Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The *Horizontal Layout* has 3 elements at  the top of the screen. It consists 
from left to right.

_The "Global Iconman" Taskbar_::
+
It is a vertical growing winlist holding each window on the current page 
as a horizontal bar labeled with the name and the title of each window. 
It moves down if the mouse hovers over the right vertical bar labeled with 
"Global Iconman". If the mouse hovers over one of the horizontal bars the 
window related to this bar gets the focus.
+
There are some mouse bindings available:
+
* double clicking or scroll down on a bar iconify the window
* double clicking or scroll up on a bar deiconify the window
* right clicking  on a bar opens a windows operation menu

_The Pager_::
+
It is a miniature illustration of the 4 virtual desktop pages (4x1) with 
mini windows. By clicking on each of the 4 segments you can change the page. 
Also you can move each window from one page to another with holding down 
the middle mouse button. If you hover over a mini window it shows the name 
and the title of it.
+
There are also some key combinations available:
+
* _Shift-Ctrl_ and _Arrow_ key right/left switch to the next/previous page.
* _Shift-Ctrl_ and _number_ 1-4 switch to page 1-4.
* _Shift-Alt_ and _Arrow_ key right/left moves the active window to the next/previous page.
* _Shift-Alt_ and _number_ 1-4 moves the active window to page 1-4.

_The Panel_::
+
It contains from left to right:
+
* The root menu. It opens by left clicking the *Fvwm-Nightshade* icon.
* The systemtray with application applets. The amount of visible applets 
depends on the screen width. If more applets in the systray than representable 
a bar on the left and right side appears while hovering over the left or 
right end of the tray. With scrolling the mouse wheel you can move throug 
the applets.
* A cpu graph with percentage.
* A Clock and date applet.

The maximum size of a window is limited by Fvwm it’s EwmhBaseStruts. So it 
will maximum growing underneath the horizontal elements. You can use _Alt-F11_ 
to grow the window to the whole screen.

Vertical Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The *Vertical Layout* has 3 elements on the right side of the screen. It 
consists from above to below:

_The Panel_::
+
It contains from above to below:

Call Sequence while Startup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first file which is called while startup is +<system>/bin/fvwm-nightshade+. 
It initialize some environment variables, creates +~/.fvwm-nightshade+ if not 
available and starts Fvwm. But not with the +<user>/config+ or +<system>/config+. 

First Fvwm starts with a pre config - +<system>/share/fvwm-nightshade/fns-init+. 
It contains some important functions which allows *Fvwm-Nightshade* to handle 
another directory than +~/.fvwm+. 

The script calls then the main config via the "Load" function. This function 
looks first in the <user> dir and then in the <system> dir. It makes it 
possible to load parts created by the user or the default ones. With that 
function the user can copy the config or bindings in the <user> dir, alter 
it and restart *Fvwm-Nightshade* without changing anything in the process.

This works with themes and layouts, too. If you create under +~/.fvwm-nightshade+ 
the directory structures of themes/layouts as in the +<system>/share/fvwm-nightshade+ 
you can build themes or layouts by your own (see THEME and LAYOUT CREATION below).

Autostart of Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Fvwm-Nightshade* has the possibility to start applications while startup 
like email daemons or systemtools (e.g. gkrellm). Therefore a file ".autostart" 
must created in the <user> directory and filled with application commands per 
line e.g.
----
sleep 2; gkrellm
----

Another possibility is to use the function "FuncStartSystrayApplets" in the 
config file but then you have to copy the system config into the <user> directory
and add your app like
-----
+ I Test (x nm-applet) exec exec nm-applet
-----


ENVIRONMENT SPECIFICATIONS
--------------------------

Global Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are some *Fvwm-Nightshade* specific variables. Valid in the shell and 
Fvwm namespace:
[cols="20%,80%",frame="none",grid="none"]
|====
|FVWM_USERDIR    	|It holds the user directory ~/.fvwm-nightshade.
|FNS_SYSTEMDIR    	|It contains the system path to the shared files of Fvwm-Nightshade - /usr/local/share/fvwm-nightshade or /usr/share/fvwm-nightshade.
|FNS_INITFILE       |It holds the path to the pre config fns-init.
|FNS_DEBUG        	|If you want to raise the message output of Fvwm-Nightshade into ~/.xsession-errors set it to 1. Default is 0.

DEBUGING
--------
If you want to debug something there are some functions available you can 
use to get output in +~/.xsession-errors+:

[cols="30%,70%",frame="none",grid="none"]
|====
|FuncPrintDbgMsg <string or value>     |This prints debug message but only if you have set FNS_DEBUG to 1 in <system>/share/fvwm-nightshade/fns-init.
|FuncPrintMsg <name> <string or value> |This function prints normal messages. Yo can use it for normal messages.
|====


THEME CREATION
--------------
A theme consists of the following parts either in +<system>/share/fvwm-nightshade/themes/<name>/+ 
or +<user>/themes/<name>/+:
[cols="10%,90%",frame="none",grid="none"]
|====
|colorsets  |Colorsets of decorations, menus, modules etc.
|decor      |Styles of titlebar, buttons, menus and theme related mouse bindings.
|images    	|optional folder for button images (SVG).
|====

If you want to build a new theme create in +<user>/themes/+ a theme directory 
with it’s name and copy the colorset template from +<system>/share/docs/fvwm-nightshade/templates+ 
into the directory.

Two different decors exist - vector based (Clean theme) and image based (Air, Ambiance, 
CrystalBalls and Tribal). Copy one of these decor files into your theme directory.

If you want to build an image related theme create also an "images" folder for 
the button images.

IMPORTANT: All image related themes are SVG themes! You can use bitmaps, but than you 
have problems with the button scaling! Also bear in mind If you want to 
send us an image related theme only SVG themes will be accepted.

Now you can adapt the files for your needs. The theme appears automatically 
in the menu
------
Configuration -> Fvwm-Nightshade -> Decoration -> Decors
------
and can be tested by clicking on the name easily.


LAYOUT CREATION
---------------
Layouts are a summary of different parts of modules like FvwmPager, FvwmButtons 
or FvwmIconMan and applets from e.g. conky.

The main part is the layout file where the positions, calculations, key 
bindings and module loadings are done. This can be very tricky and the 
only thing we can say is - look into the Horizontal, Vertical or G2like 
layout to get an overview

Generally the structure is as follow:

1. You have to thought about the positioning of your elements and their 
dependencies to each other.
2. You must define your working area (maximized window) and the Iconbox 
for your iconified windows.
3. Now the "Load" part follows to initialize your modules with the calculated 
positioning values.
4. The next step is to include your modules in the Start Function that your 
theme will be loaded correctly after a restart.
5. In the ReloadLayoutParts function you define all your layout needed to 
function properly after calling it from the configuration menu.
6. Next you have to define your key bindings if any. Mostly needed for the 
pager module or if you have other special things implemented.
7. Then the menus following. Also needed mostly for the pager.

You can test it easily by clicking your layout name under
----
Configuration -> Fvwm-Nightshade -> Decoration -> Layouts
------

if it found under +<user>/layouts/+. It appears automatically.

That’s it. Not much but hopefully enough for playing ;).

LANGUAGE CREATION
-----------------
*Fvwm-Nightshade* supports a couple of languages - at the moment german, 
russian, spanish, italian and french. If you want to create your own 
translation you can use the "fvwm-nightshade.pot" template located in +<system>/templates+.

We support *two* locations where your translation can copy to:

. The system wide in +/usr/share/locale/+ or +/usr/local/share/locale/+
. The user wide in +~/fvwm-nightshade/locale/+

The following Howto uses the user wide one.

Steps for your own translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Create the directory with its' sub directories:
+
----
~/.fvwm-nightshade/locale/<your_lang>/LC_MESSAGES
----
. Copy fvwm-nightshade.pot to this directory:
+
----
$> cp <system>/templates/fvwm-nightshade.pot ~/.fvwm-nightshade/locale/<your_lang>/LC_MESSAGES/fvwm-nightshade.po
----
+
TIP: You can look to +/usr/share/locale+ which token is normally used for your language.

. Open it with your favorite editor, fill out the header and translate 
the messages into your language. 

. Create the machine readable code with _msgfmt_
+
----
$> msgfmt fvwm-nightshade.po -o fvwm-nightshade.mo
----

. Restart *Fvwm-Nightshade*.

Now all menus, messages and tools should be shown in your language.

*Remark:*

* Some messages have a fixed size and spaces at the beginning or the end. 
They should used in the translation just as well! For example:
+
----
msgid "              (E.g. 10, 11, 13)"
msgstr "              (z.B. 10, 11, 13)"
----
* Menu entries have *&* for hotkeys. So you should set them that no double 
underlines exist.
* Every time you change something in the *po* file a restart of *Fvwm-Nightshade* 
is necessary if it is related to menu entries. All others like in *FvwmScripts* 
or *FvwmForms* are shown after restart of the application.

TIP: You can use *poedit* or *KBabel* instead of an editor for translation. It's 
a matter of choice ;-) ...

MODULE CREATION
---------------
If you want to create your own modules based on fvwm-perlib you have three 
possibilities to put them in:

. Fvwm its own directory, usually /usr/lib/fvwm/<Fvwm-version/
. Fvwm-Nightshades system directory - <system>/share/fvwm-nightshade/lib/
. The user directory in <user>/lib/

The easiest way is the user directory. Create the directory ~/.fvwm-nightshade/lib 
and put your module in it. Now you can start it from within FvwmConsole with

----
Module <Modulename>
----

or in the StartFunction with

----
+ I Module <Modulename>
----

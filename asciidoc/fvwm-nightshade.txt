Call Sequence while Startup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first file which is called while startup is +<system>/bin/fvwm-nightshade+. 
It initialize some environment variables, creates +~/.fvwm-nightshade+ if not 
available and starts Fvwm. But not with the +<user>/config+ or +<system>/config+. 

First Fvwm starts with a pre config - +<system>/share/fvwm-nightshade/fns-init+. 
It contains some important functions which allows *Fvwm-Nightshade* to handle 
another directory than +~/.fvwm+. 

The script calls then the main config via the "Load" function. This function 
looks first in the <user> dir and then in the <system> dir. It makes it 
possible to load parts created by the user or the default ones. With that 
function the user can copy the config or bindings in the <user> dir, alter 
it and restart *Fvwm-Nightshade* without changing anything in the process.

This works with themes and layouts, too. If you create under +~/.fvwm-nightshade+ 
the directory structures of themes/layouts as in the +<system>/share/fvwm-nightshade+ 
you can build themes or layouts by your own (see THEME and LAYOUT CREATION below).

Autostart of Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Fvwm-Nightshade* has the possibility to start applications while startup 
like email daemons or systemtools (e.g. gkrellm). Therefore a file ".autostart" 
must created in the <user> directory and filled with application commands per 
line e.g.
----
thunderbird
----

Another possibility is to use the function "FuncStartSystrayApplets" in the 
config file but then you have to copy the system file 'config' into the <user> 
directory and add your app like
-----
+ I Test (x nm-applet) exec exec nm-applet
-----

[cols="30%,70%",frame="none",grid="none"]
|====

|FuncPrintMsg <name> <string or value> |This function prints normal messages. Yo can use it for normal messages.
|====


THEME CREATION
--------------
A theme consists of the following parts either in +<system>/share/fvwm-nightshade/themes/<name>/+ 
or +<user>/themes/<name>/+:
[cols="10%,90%",frame="none",grid="none"]
|====
|colorsets  |Colorsets of decorations, menus, modules etc.
|decor      |Styles of titlebar, buttons, menus and theme related mouse bindings.
|images    	|optional folder for button images (SVG).
|====

If you want to build a new theme create in +<user>/themes/+ a theme directory 
with itâ€™s name and copy the colorset template from +<system>/share/docs/fvwm-nightshade/templates+ 
into the directory.

Two different decors exist - vector based (Clean theme) and image based (Air, Ambiance, 
CrystalBalls, etc.). Copy one of these decor files into your theme directory.

If you want to build an image related theme create also an "images" folder for 
the button images.

IMPORTANT: All image related themes are SVG themes! You can use bitmaps, but than you 
have problems with the button scaling! Also bear in mind If you want to 
send us an image related theme only SVG themes will be accepted.

Now you can adapt the files for your needs. The theme appears automatically 
in the menu
------
Configuration -> Fvwm-Nightshade -> Decoration -> Decors
------
and can be tested by clicking on the name easily.


LAYOUT CREATION
---------------
Layouts are a summary of different parts of modules like FvwmPager, FvwmButtons 
or FvwmIconMan and applets from e.g. conky.

The main part is the layout file where the positions, calculations, key 
bindings and module loadings are done. This can be very tricky and the 
only thing we can say is - look into the Horizontal, Vertical or G2like 
layout to get an overview

Generally the structure is as follow:

1. You have to thought about the positioning of your elements and their 
dependencies to each other.
2. You must define your working area (maximized window) and the Iconbox 
for your iconified windows.
3. Now the "Load" part follows to initialize your modules with the calculated 
positioning values.
4. The next step is to include your modules in the Start Function that your 
theme will be loaded correctly after a restart.
5. In the ReloadLayoutParts function you define all your layout needed to 
function properly after calling it from the configuration menu.
6. Next you have to define your key bindings if any. Mostly needed for the 
pager module or if you have other special things implemented.
7. Then the menus following. Also needed mostly for the pager.

You can test it easily by clicking your layout name under
----
Configuration -> Fvwm-Nightshade -> Decoration -> Layouts
------

if it found under +<user>/layouts/+. It appears automatically.

Thatâ€™s it. Not much but hopefully enough for playing ;).

LANGUAGE CREATION
-----------------
*Fvwm-Nightshade* supports a couple of languages - at the moment german, 
russian, spanish, italian and french. If you want to create your own 
translation you can use the "fvwm-nightshade.pot" template located in +<system>/templates+.

We support *two* locations where your translation can copy to:

. The system wide in +/usr/share/locale/+ or +/usr/local/share/locale/+
. The user wide in +~/fvwm-nightshade/locale/+

The following Howto uses the user wide one.

Steps for your own translation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
. Create the directory with its' sub directories:
+
----
~/.fvwm-nightshade/locale/<your_lang>/LC_MESSAGES
----
. Copy fvwm-nightshade.pot to this directory:
+
----
$> cp <system>/templates/fvwm-nightshade.pot ~/.fvwm-nightshade/locale/<your_lang>/LC_MESSAGES/fvwm-nightshade.po
----
+
TIP: You can look to +/usr/share/locale+ which token is normally used for your language.

. Open it with your favorite editor, fill out the header and translate 
the messages into your language. 

. Create the machine readable code with _msgfmt_
+
----
$> msgfmt fvwm-nightshade.po -o fvwm-nightshade.mo
----

. Restart *Fvwm-Nightshade*.

Now all menus, messages and tools should be shown in your language.

*Remark:*

* Some messages have a fixed size and spaces at the beginning or the end. 
They should used in the translation just as well! For example:
+
----
msgid "              (E.g. 10, 11, 13)"
msgstr "              (z.B. 10, 11, 13)"
----
* Menu entries have *&* for hotkeys. So you should set them that no double 
underlines exist.
* Every time you change something in the *po* file a restart of *Fvwm-Nightshade* 
is necessary if it is related to menu entries. All others like in *FvwmScripts* 
or *FvwmForms* are shown after restart of the application.

TIP: You can use *poedit* or *KBabel* instead of an editor for translation. It's 
a matter of choice ;-) ...

If you need more information about the used translation process see 
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html

MODULE CREATION
---------------
If you want to create your own modules based on fvwm-perlib you have three 
possibilities to put them in:

. Fvwm its own directory, usually /usr/lib/fvwm/<Fvwm-version/
. Fvwm-Nightshades system directory - <system>/share/fvwm-nightshade/lib/
. The user directory in <user>/lib/

The easiest way is the user directory. Create the directory ~/.fvwm-nightshade/lib 
and put your module in it. Now you can start it from within FvwmConsole with

----
Module <Modulename>
----

or in the StartFunction with

----
+ I Module <Modulename>

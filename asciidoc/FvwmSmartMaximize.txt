NAME
----

FvwmSmartMaximize - The smart maximize module


SYNOPSIS
--------

*FvwmSmartMaximize* can only be invoked by fvwm. Command line invocation 
of the B<FvwmSmartMaximize> module will not work.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This module moves and resizes a current window to the largest free area 
of the desktop/page. If no place found nothing happens.

INVOCATION
----------
*FvwmSmartMaximize* can be invoked by inserting the line 'Module FvwmSmartMaximize' 
in the StartFunction declarations in the .fvwm2rc file. 

To call *FvwmSmartMaximize* it has to be bound to a menu, mouse button, or keystroke.


OPTIONS
-------
Two main options exist needed for calling *FvwmSmartMaximize* from a menu, 
mouse button, or keystroke.

*All* '[screen]'::
+
All windows on the current page are included in the calculation of the 
largest free area. If maximized windows are available they will block 
the smart maximization and nothing will happen.

*IgnoreMaxWindows* '[screen]'::
+
All windows on the current page except maximized windows are included in 
the calculation of the largest free area. This is the preffered option.

For multi display screens there's an addition to the main options:

'[screen]'::
+
With this addition B<FvwmSmartMaximize> will only use the current screen 
for placing. Else the complete display is used.

EXAMPLES
--------
To use *FvwmSmartMaximize* three parts have to be implemented:

. You can copy B<FvwmSmartMaximize> in the lib directory of Fvwm. To get the path type in a terminal

----
$ echo $FVWM_MODULEDIR
----
    
Or you can implement your own in your .fvwm2rc file with:
   
----
ModulePath $[FVWM_USERDIR]/lib:+
----

Now copy B<FvwmSmartMaximize> into your own module path.
   
. The module initialization in the StartFunction declaration in your .fvwm2rc file:

----
DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Module FvwmSmartMaximize
----

. A menu, mouse button, or keystroke binding:

----
Mouse 1 4 M SendToModule FvwmSmartMaximize IgnoreMaxWindows screen
----
    
This binds the call to mouse button 1 (left button) + Alt-Key and to the window button 4. So if you hold Alt and click on the window button 4 B<FvwmSmartMaximize> is smart maximizing the active window to the largest free area on the current screen, ignoring maximized windows.
   
----
Key Super_L WTSF N SendToModule FvwmSmartMaximize All
----

This binds the call to the left Windows key and smart maximizing the active window to the largest free area on the whole desktop if no maximized window blocks it.

DEVELOPMENT
-----------
We are a young project, so many parts need a helping hand. Possible tasks are:

Testing / Bug reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the most important parts is to find bugs in functionality or look 
and feel. To get Fvwm-Nightshade working on different platforms every help 
is welcome. 

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~
Do you like programming with Python, Perl, Bash and donâ€™t balk to learn 
new things? We need creative and interested people who loves challenges!

Artwork
~~~~~~~
If you like to design themes or other eye candies become a part of our team!

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By providing useful and up-to-date documentation, you would help us by 
writing Howtos and other not available documentation. 

Translation
~~~~~~~~~~~
At the moment Fvwm-Nightshade supports English, German, French, Spanish 
and Russian. Other translations (Documentation and po files) are more than 
welcome ^^

msgid "Raise if focused"

msgid "Controls if the window is raised when focused (depending on the focus model)."

msgid "Stack Transient Parent"

msgid ""
"This style transfers the raise action to the main window makes raise on a "

msgid "No Raise Click on Motion"

msgid ""
"If this style is used, clicking in a window and then dragging the pointer with "
"the button held down does not count as the click to raise the window. Instead, "
"the application processes these events normally. This is useful to select text "
"in a terminal window with the mouse without raising the window. However, mouse "
"bindings on the client window are not guaranteed to work anymore. The distance "
"that the pointer must be moved to trigger this is controlled by the MoveThreshold below."

msgid " Window Placement "
msgstr ""

msgid "Tile Cascade Placement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Places new windows in a smart location - a location in which they do not overlap any "
"other windows on the screen. If no such position can be found Cascade Placement is "
"used as a fall-back method."
msgstr ""

msgid "Manual Placement"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the same as Tile Cascade Placement, but uses Manual Placement as the fall-back method."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cascade Placement"
msgstr ""

msgid "Place new windows in a cascading fashion."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tile Manual Placement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The user is required to place every new window manually. The window only shows as a rubber "
"band until a place is selected manually. The window is placed when a mouse button or any "
"key except Escape is pressed. Escape aborts manual placement which places the window in the "
"top left corner of the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid "Position Placement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When used with 'TopLeft', new windows are placed in the top left corner of the display. "
"With 'Center', all new window appear at the center of the screen, and with 'UnderMouse', "
"windows are centered under the mouse pointer where possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With 'TopLeft', new windows are placed in the top left corner of the display. With 'Center', "
"all new window appear at the center of the screen, and with 'UnderMouse', windows are centered "
"under the mouse pointer where possible."
msgstr ""

msgid "Min Overlap Placement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Automatically places new windows in a location in which the overlapping area in pixels "
"of other windows is minimized. By default this placement policy tries to avoid "
"overlapping icons and windows on higher layers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Penalties:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Penalties takes at most 6 positive or null decimal arguments: 'normal' 'ontop' 'icon' 'sticky' "
"'below' 'strut'. \n\nThe 'normal' factor affects normal windows, the 'ontop' factor affects windows "
"with a greater layer than the window being placed, the 'icon' factor affects icons, the 'sticky' "
"factor affects sticky windows, the 'below' factor affects windows with a smaller layer than the window "
"being placed, the 'strut' factor affects the complement of the EWMH working area if the window being "
"placed has the EWMHPlacementUseWorkingArea style and windows with an EWMH strut hint (i.e., a 'please "
"do not cover me' hint) if the window being placed has the EWMHPlacementUseDynamicWorkingArea style. "
"These 'factors' represent the amount of area that these types of windows (or area) are counted as, when "
"a new window is placed. For example, by default the area of ontop windows is counted 5 times as much as normal windows."
msgstr ""

msgid "Min Overlap Percent Placement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tries to minimize the overlapped percentages of other windows instead of the overlapped area in pixels. "
"This placement policy tries to avoid covering other windows completely and tries even harder not to cover small windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Penalties takes at most 4 positive or null integer arguments: 'cover_100' 'cover_95' 'cover_85' "
"'cover_75'. The 'cover_xx' factor is used when the window being placed covers at least xx percent of "
"the window. This factor is added to the factor determined by the Min Overlap Placement Penalties."

msgid "Hide Geometry Window"
msgstr ""

msgid "Hides the position or size window that is usually shown when a window is moved or resized interactively."
msgstr ""

msgid "Resize Opaque"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instructs fvwm to resize the corresponding windows with their contents visible "
"instead of using an outline. Since this causes the application to redraw frequently "
"it can be quite slow and make the window flicker excessively, depending on the amount "
"of graphics the application redraws. Some applications do not like their windows being "
"resized opaque, e.g. XEmacs or terminals with a pixmap background."
msgstr ""

msgid "Move Threshold:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the user presses a mouse button upon an object fvwm waits to see if the action "
"is a click or a drag. If the mouse moves by more than x pixels (default is 3) it is "
"assumed to be a drag (the default value might be increased when 16000x9000 pixel displays become affordable)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Opaque Move Size:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tells fvwm the maximum size window with which opaque window movement should be used. "
"The percentage is percent of the total screen area (may be greater than 100). With a "
"value of 0 all windows are moved using the traditional rubber-band outline. -1 is "
"given all windows are moved as solid windows. The default is 5 which allows small "
"windows to be moved in an opaque manner but large windows are moved as rubber-bands."

Installing Fvwm-Nightshade
==========================

Requirements
============

Required:	Fvwm >= 2.6.6 (compiled with all features), python-xdg, 
			xterm, conky, xscreensaver, eterm, imagemagick, xwd,
			stalonetray, wm-icons

Recommended: gnomes network manager, Volume Icon

Useful:		fdpowermon, bluetooth-applet, pm-utils, LxApearance, 
			qtconfig for qt3, qtconfig for qt4, xneurs



Preparation
===========

Fvwm
----

1. Get latest Fvwm 
    a. from distribution if available
    b. from Fvwm homepage
	- open http://www.fvwm.org/download/ and download latest snapshot (use cvs instead 
	  because fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl is missing - status: 11.2012)
	- unpack it
    c. from Fvwm CVS:
	- Open http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_cvs.php
	- Do the Initial Setup
	- Checking Out Source Code:
	   $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm co -r branch-2_6 fvwm

2. Prepare environment
    rpm:
	- follow instructions under http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_creating_rpms.php
	  "Before you Begin" and install listed packages (don't forget 'rpm-build' ^^).
	- next step "Where rpms will be created" and create ~/.rpmmacros file with
	  %_topdir /home/<your_user_home>/redhat
	- read "Creating binary and source rpm packages" but wait ...
	    unfortunatelly rpm-dist doesn't work at the moment. You've to fix the following:
	    - rename bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl into bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl.in
	    - add in configure.ac after line 1766:
	      bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl
	
	deb/Arch:
	- it's mostly easier to do "3. Building the Tree" before installing packages because the 
	  absent packages/dev-libs are in braces in the "no" lines at the end of the summary ;)
	- deb: if X11/Intrinsic.h not found while make you need package libXt-dev, too.
	- Arch: xsltproc is equivalent to libxslt. librplay not available but normally not needed.
	
3. Building the Tree:
	- execute in the terminal
       $ utils/configure_dev.sh
       
       Hint:
       You can ignore "With GNOME libs support in FvwmGtk? no: Can't find working gnome-config" 
       because Fvwm wants Gtk+ Version 1 which is obsolete since ages and newer distributions 
       don't has it anymore. 

4. Compile Fvwm:
	deb:
    - run 
		$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
	- after that
		$ make deb-inplace
		
    rpm:
    - run
		$ make rpm-dist
	
	Arch:
	- build the package:
		1. Create directory where you want to build the package and change to
			$ mkdir -p /home/<your_user_name>/packages/fvwm
			$ cd /home/<your_user_name>/packages/fvwm
		2. Copy from arch/PKGBUILD_FVWM into the directory rename it to PKGBUILD and run
			$ makepkg
		3. enter password 'guest' for CVS login

4. Install Fvwm
	- To install Fvwm you need root rights!
	rpm:
		- The package is located under /home/[your_user_name]/redhat/RPMS/i386/
		# rpm -ivh /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/i386/fvwm-2.6.x-0.<date>.i386.rpm
	deb:
		- The package is created one level higher than the fvwm/fvwm-snapshot folder
		# dpkg -i ../<path_to_fvwm/fvwm-snapshot>/fvwm-2.6.x-0.<date>.i386.deb
	Arch:
		- The package is created in the previous generated directory. Run
		# pacman -U fvwm-cvs-2.6.6-1-architecture.pkg.tar.xz
	


Installation of Fvwm-Nightshade
===============================

1. download package from https://github.com/Fvwm-Nightshade/Fvwm-Nightshade/tree/develop
2. unpack it and switch into the expanded directory
   Remark: don't use file-roller because the tool cannot handle unix rights in zip files
           Use unzip instead.
3. There're different possibilities to install Fvwm-Nightshade
	- General
		Fvwm-Nightshade will be installed to /usr/local by default. So root
		permissions are required. Run
  
			# make install

		If you want to install Fvwm-Nightshade to another directory you can 
		change the prefix:

		    # make prefix=<other_dir> install

		If Fvwm is installed in another directory then /usr/share/fvwm you have
		to told make where because there are some scripts which have to be installed
		into Fvwm. 
   
			# make fvwm_path=<path_to_fvwm> install
	- deb:
		Run
			# make deb
		A Debian package is created in the directory above. Install it with a two liner:
			# dpkg -i fvwm-nightshade-<version>.deb
			# apt-get -f install
	- rpm:
		Type in the terminal
			# make rpm
		A rpm package is created in /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/noarch/. Install it with
			Fedora/Redhat:
			# yum --nogpgcheck localinstall /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/noarch/fvwm-nightshade_<version>_noarch.rpm
			SuSE:
			# yast -i /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/noarch/fvwm-nightshade_<version>_noarch.rpm
			For others (dependencies must installed before):
			# rpm -ivh /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/noarch/fvwm-nightshade_<version>_noarch.rpm
	- Arch:
		Type in the terminal
			# make arch
		The package is created in the directory 'arch' above. Run as root
			# pacman -U fvwm-nightshade-version.pkg.tar.xz
		

Now Fvwm-Nightshade is installed and you can login, change the base settings and enjoy.



Deinstallation
==============
- General
	To remove Fvwm-Nightshade expect ~/.fvwm-nightshade run as root

			# make uninstall

	If you have installed Fvwm-Nightshade to another directory you have to change the prefix:

			# make prefix=<other_dir> install

	Also, if Fvwm is installed in another directory then /usr/share/fvwm you have
	to told make where Fvwm is located

			# make fvwm_path=<path_to_fvwm> uninstall
			
- For all others use the package management system.


Tips

How to get the required packages
--------------------------------

Some distributions haven't all packages in their main repositories. But you can get them
over some other ways.

OpenSuse:
http://software.opensuse.org/search

To install a downloaded package use yast (as root) to solve package dependencies with

	# yast -i <path_to_rpm_package>

Fedora:
https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/

To install a downloaded package use yum (as root) to solve package dependencies with

	# yum --nogpgcheck localinstall <path_to_rpm_package>

Some package search sites:
http://pkgs.org
http://rpm.pbone.net/

Installing Fvwm-Nightshade
==========================

Requirements
============

Required:       Fvwm >= 2.6.5, python-2.7, python-xdg, xterm, conky, 
                xscreensaver, feh, imagemagick, librsvg2, xwd,
                stalonetray, cpufrequtils*, gksu/beesu

Recommended:    gnomes network manager, Volume Icon

Useful:         fdpowermon, bluetooth-applet, pm-utils, LxApearance, 
                qtconfig for qt3, qtconfig for qt4, xneurs

* unfortunatelly not usable in Arch at the moment. They have changed from
  cpufrequtils to cpupower but it's not supported at the moment 
  -> see issue #40 in the bugtracker.

Preparation
===========

Fvwm
----

1. Get latest Fvwm 
    a. from distribution if available
    b. from Fvwm homepage
    - open http://www.fvwm.org/download/ and download latest release
    - unpack it
    c. from Fvwm CVS:
    - Open http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_cvs.php
    - Do the Initial Setup
    - Checking Out Source Code:
       $ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fvwm.org:/home/cvs/fvwm co -r branch-2_6 fvwm

    If distribution package is not available (b and c)
    1. Prepare environment 
        rpm:
        - follow instructions under http://www.fvwm.org/documentation/dev_creating_rpms.php
          "Before you Begin" and install listed packages (don't forget 'rpm-build' ^^).
        - next step "Where rpms will be created" and create ~/.rpmmacros file with
          %_topdir /home/<your_user_home>/redhat
        - read "Creating binary and source rpm packages" but wait ...
            unfortunatelly rpm-dist doesn't work at the moment. You've to fix the following:
            - rename bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl into bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl.in
            - add in configure.ac after line 1766:
              bin/fvwm-menu-desktop-config.fpl
        
        deb:
        - it's mostly easier to do "3. Building the Tree" before installing packages because the 
          absent packages/dev-libs are in braces in the "no" lines at the end of the summary ;)
        - if X11/Intrinsic.h not found while make you need package libXt-dev, too.
        
        Arch:
        - xsltproc is equivalent to libxslt. librplay not available but normally not needed.
        - next step: 4. Compile Fvwm
    
    2. Building the Tree:
    - execute in the terminal
        $ utils/configure_dev.sh
       
       Hint:
       You can ignore "With GNOME libs support in FvwmGtk? no: Can't find working gnome-config" 
       because Fvwm wants Gtk+ Version 1 which is obsolete since ages and newer distributions 
       don't has it anymore. 

    3. Compile Fvwm:
        deb:
        - run 
           $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
        - after that
           $ make deb-inplace
            
        rpm:
        - run
        $ make rpm-dist
        
        Arch:
        - build the package:
            1. Create directory where you want to build the package and change to
                $ mkdir -p /home/<your_user_name>/packages/fvwm
                $ cd /home/<your_user_name>/packages/fvwm
            2. Copy from arch/PKGBUILD_FVWM into the directory rename it to PKGBUILD and run
                $ makepkg -s
            3. enter password 'guest' for CVS login

2. Install Fvwm
    - To install Fvwm you need root rights!
    a. from distribution
        use the package manager
    b/c. from Fvwm homepage
        rpm:
            - The package is located under /home/[your_user_name]/redhat/RPMS/i386/
            # rpm -ivh /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/i386/fvwm-2.6.x-0.<date>.i386.rpm
        deb:
            - The package is created one level higher than the fvwm folder
            # dpkg -i ../<path_to_fvwm>/fvwm-2.6.x-0.<date>.i386.deb
        Arch:
            - The package is created in the previous generated directory. Run
            # pacman -U fvwm-cvs-2.6.6-1-architecture.pkg.tar.xz
    


Installation of Fvwm-Nightshade
===============================

1. download package from http://fvwm-nightshade.github.io/Fvwm-Nightshade
2. unpack it and switch into the expanded directory
   Remark: don't use file-roller because the tool cannot handle unix rights in zip files
           Use unzip instead.
3. Switch into the unpacked directory
4. Now you have different possibilities to install Fvwm-Nightshade.
    - General
        Fvwm-Nightshade will be installed to /usr/local by default. So root
        permissions are required. Run
  
            # make install

        If you want to install Fvwm-Nightshade to another directory you can 
        change the prefix:

            # make prefix=<other_dir> install
        
        If you haven't installed a display-manager like GDM you can add the option
        displaymanager=no to the make call:

            # make install displaymanager=no

        If Fvwm is installed in another directory then /usr/share/fvwm you have
        to told make where because there are some scripts which have to be installed
        into Fvwm. 
   
              # make fvwm_path=<path_to_fvwm> install
          
        If you haven't root rights you can install Fvwm-Nightshade locally. All you
        need is a directory e.g. ~/.local with write permissions. Also an entry in 
        your PATH variable in your .bashrc, .bash_profile or .profile like
          
              PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
          
        Now you can install Fvwm-Nightshade with the following make call:

              $ make prefix=~/.local install local=yes
          
        Don't forget to install the required packages from the beginning of this document!

    - deb:
        Run
            # make deb
        A Debian package is created in the directory above. Install it with the two liner:
            # dpkg -i fvwm-nightshade-<version>.deb
            # apt-get -f install
    - rpm:
        Type in the terminal
            # make rpm
        A rpm package is created in /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/noarch/. Install it with
            Fedora/Redhat:
            # yum --nogpgcheck localinstall /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/noarch/fvwm-nightshade_<version>_noarch.rpm
            SuSE:
            # yast -i /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/noarch/fvwm-nightshade_<version>_noarch.rpm
            For others (dependencies must installed before):
            # rpm -ivh /home/<your_user_name>/redhat/RPMS/noarch/fvwm-nightshade_<version>_noarch.rpm
    - Arch:
        Type in the terminal
            # make arch
        The package is created in the directory above. Run as root
            # pacman -U fvwm-nightshade-<version>-any.pkg.tar.xz
    - Gentoo:
        An additional overlay repository for custom ebuilds which are not in the official
        Portage is needed. It will be set over the PORTDIR_OVERLAY variable in 
        /etc/portage/make.conf. The normal personal per-machine overlay is /usr/local/portage.
        But another could used also.
        
        The Fvwm-Nightshade ebuild has to be created from the template in gentoo/.
        Also the dist package for the installation. This can done with one step.
        Type in the terminal:
            $ make prepare-gentoo
        The make rule creates the dist package ../fvwm-nightshade-<version>.tar.gz and adds 
        the current version of the downloaded package to the ebuild name and saves it in 
        the current directory.
        
        A sub directory 'fvwm-nightshade' in the category 'x11-themes' have to be created
        (if you use the overlay /usr/local/portage you need root permissions!):
            $|# mkdir -p <overlay_directory>/x11-themes/fvwm-nightshade
        
        Copy the versioned fvwm-nightshade ebuild into your personal overlay repository:
            $|# cp fvwm-nightshade-<version>.ebuild <overlay_directory>/x11-themes/fvwm-nightshade/
        
        Copy the dist package as root to /usr/portage/disfiles:
            # cp ../fvwm-nightshade-<version>.tar.gz /usr/portage/disfiles/
        
        Create the manifest:
            $|# ebuild --force <overlay_directory>/x11-themes/fvwm-nightshade/fvwm-nightshade-<version>.ebuild digest
        
        Unmask the package with your system architecture -> ~x86 or ~amd64 :
            # echo x11-themes/fvwm-nightshade ~x86 >> /etc/portage/package.keywords
        
        Install Fvwm-Nightshade with
            # emerge x11-themes/fvwm-nightshade
        
        Perhaps you need some additional USEs. Emerge told you which. Echo them into /etc/portage/package.use:
            # echo "<USEs>" >> /etc/portage/package.use
        
        Emerge again.

Fvwm-Nightshade is installed. Congratulation!

If you haven't a graphical login manager copy xinitrc template into your home directory 
    $ cp <system>/share/doc/fvwm-nightshade/xinitrc-example ~/.xinitrc
or add the following line to your .xinitrc:
    exec fvwm-nightshade
and start the xserver with
    $ startx

Change the base settings and enjoy.

If you have a graphical login manager there's now a new entry "Fvwm-Nightshade" in your sessions dialog.
Login, change the base settings and enjoy.

If you have installed Fvwm-Nightshade locally and want to use a display-manager copy (with root rights) 
fvwm-nightshade.desktop-example from the doc directory to /usr/share/xsessions:
    # cp <system>/share/doc/fvwm-nightshade/fvwm-nightshade.desktop-example /usr/share/xsessions/fvwm-nightshade.desktop


Deinstallation
==============
- General
    To remove Fvwm-Nightshade expect ~/.fvwm-nightshade run as root

        # make uninstall

    If you have installed Fvwm-Nightshade to another directory you have to change the prefix:

        # make prefix=<other_dir> uninstall

    That applies for local installation without root rights, too.
    
    Also, if Fvwm is installed in another directory then /usr/share/fvwm you have
    to told make where Fvwm is located

        # make fvwm_path=<path_to_fvwm> uninstall
    
    Since 0.6.7 'make install' creates an install log. For previous versions which haven't this
    file you must use
        
        # make uninstall-alternative
    
    It checks the default installation locations and try to uninstall all installed files. Maybe
    some files won't found. Excuse the inconvenience.
            
- For all others use the package management system.


Tips

How to get the required packages
--------------------------------

Some distributions haven't all packages in their main repositories. But you can get them
over some other ways.

OpenSuse:
http://software.opensuse.org/search

To install a downloaded package use yast (as root) to solve package dependencies with

    # yast -i <path_to_rpm_package>

Fedora:
https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/

To install a downloaded package use yum (as root) to solve package dependencies with

    # yum --nogpgcheck localinstall <path_to_rpm_package>

Arch:
https://www.archlinux.org/packages/
https://www.archlinux.org/packages/

To install a downloaded package use pacman (as root) to solve package dependencies with

    # pacman -U <path_to_arch_package>

Fvwm-Nightshade Release Notes
=============================

Version 0.7.x

Features:
---------
- new feature smart maximize - moves and resizes a current window to the 
  largest free area of a desktop/page (thanks to Andreas Hoenen ^^)
- right click menu for cpu bar to restart them on error and start other 
  related scripts/applets.
- new set of icons for menus and internal apps to remove wm-icons dependency
  because this package isn't available in all distributions and of its' 
  unscalability. Also special thanks to Alessandro Roncone who gives us 
  the permission to use his Awoken icons :-).
- new python script fns-find-file to search for files in path variables 
  like $PATH or $FNS_SOUNDPATH.

Version 0.6.7 (09th July 2013)

Changes:
--------
- Fix issue #38 - Enhance uninstall routine
  Makefile supports now the creation of an install list so keep the sources

  It is now possible to install Fvwm-Nightshade without the login file
  fvwm-nightshade.desktop. Also local installation can be done if user
  hasn't root rights.
- exchange Esetroot with feh because of the poor availability in different
